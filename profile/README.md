## What is Omni?🤔
Omni is a protocol that allows user to easily create and trade derivatives of real world assets on chain, with omni creators and protocols can on ramp prices of everyday items like shoes, drinks and other regular real world assets.
### Why do we need this?
Current DEXs are serious and focus on liquidity provision for stablecoins, nativecoins, govenance tokens and other "serious" derivatives and on the flip side memecoins with high volatilty and almost no utilty. Omni brings the prices fun little items on chain for creators to build sythetic and primitives off these assets. We do this using two components a ZkTLS | DLMM. The goal is to create an alternative market for these assets that intersect culture and on chain finance and see where it goes.
Ideas of projects that can be built using Omni is giftcards, Onchain StockX for sneakerheads, real world redeemable rewards for onchain and off-chain interactions.
### How does Omni do this?
Omni uses a web proofs(zk) to bring data on chain store in comppressed accounts(gas costs) currently push but building towards an on demand model. Currently a PoC Omni hopes to drive pop culture on chain by building tools that provide new and easier ways to provide liquidity as well meet creators and consumers where they are.
