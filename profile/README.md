## What is Omni?🤔
Omni is another oracle just like pyth and switchboard just lower barriers to entry to provisioning data on chain, with omni creators and protocols can on ramp prices of everyday items like shoes, drinks and other regular real world assets.
### Why do we need this?
Oracles are serious and focus on institutional data like sovereign currency pairs and stocks. Omni brings the prices fun little items on chain for creators to build sythetic and primitives off these price.
Ideas of projects that can be built using Omni is giftcards, Onchain StockX for sneakerheads, real world redeemable rewards for onchain interactions.
### How does Omni do this?
Omni uses a push method to provide data on chain. Data is provided every 10secs (to go lower over time) although currently a proof of concept. V2 of Omni will allows decentralized data providers with staking and slashing mechanisms to incentived correct data.


The goal is to remove central actors and single points of failure in the data provision process. Brands or anybody really can create Assets and have group of people stake to these assets in SOL (support for LSTs coming sooon). More stake together with some other determining factors will affect the asset reputation point.


> [!TIP]
> #### Glossary:
> Reputation Point: Reputation points determine how credible an Asset price is. Ranging from 1-10. Consumers of these data can immediately know what assets fits their use case.  


Build with stuff you already like on chain with Omni🚀🌍
