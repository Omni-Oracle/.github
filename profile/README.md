## What is Omni?🤔
Omni is a protocol that provides tooling for verifiable offchain actions on chain to power the next gen of consumer apps on Solana?
Current DEXs and DeFi are serious and focus on liquidity provision for stablecoins, nativecoins, govenance tokens and other "serious" derivatives and on the flip side memecoins have created a new way to speculate using DeFi paradigms, we believe memecoins can unlock multiple use cases for socialFi but lack tooling for curation, aggregation and offchain composabilty.


Omni is hub that pieces all these component on chain for creators to build sythetic and primitives off these assets. Our Flagship tooling: ZkTLS Oracle and product: Narrative are the first shot at creating this ecosystem of tools. The goal is to create an alternative market for these assets that intersect culture and on chain finance and see where it goes.

Ideas of projects that can be built using Omni is giftcards, Onchain StockX for sneakerheads, real world redeemable rewards for onchain and off-chain interactions.
### How does Omni do this?
Omni uses a web proofs(zk) to bring data on chain store in comppressed accounts(gas costs) currently push but building towards an on demand model. Currently a PoC Omni hopes to drive pop culture on chain by building tools that provide new and easier ways to provide liquidity as well meet creators and consumers where they are.
